# Make That Pipe Sound

Make simple pipe instruments and play them together.
Everyone gets a single pipe of a defined length and has to hit on one end of the pipe.
Each pipe has a color to distinguish it.
A web app shows the colors to hit on.
This makes a quick and simple orchestra, quite some fun and even some team building.


# Instructions: Build The Pipes

Pick a PVC Pipe with 25mm diameter and about 1mm wall thickness, e.g. "EN25 320N".
They are typically used to build electric wiring in your house and can be bought cheeply from your local DIY warehouse.
Use the following table to cut the pipes into segments of the given length.
Then use sandpaper to make the ends smooth.
Finally add duct tape in the respective color to them to ensure that it is easy to identify the pipe.

You may use apps such as
[Nail the Pitch](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.autumnrockdev.nailthepitch&utm_source=emea_Med)
to verify that the pipe lengths produce the correct sounds for you.

Note: make your pipe 1.0595 times longer to get a pitch one half-note deeper (and 1.122 longer for a full note).
Apply this to the values given below to add more notes.
